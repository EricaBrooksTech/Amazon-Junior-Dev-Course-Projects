# 🧮 BMI Calculator (Java)

This project is a simple **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator written in Java. It demonstrates how to use **method overloading**, **basic math operations**, and **Java classes and objects** to calculate BMI in both **imperial** and **metric** units.

## 📌 What Is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a measure of body fat based on weight and height:

- **Metric Formula:**  
  **BMI** = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))

- **Imperial Formula:**  
  **BMI** = (weight (lb) × 703) / (height (in) × height (in))
