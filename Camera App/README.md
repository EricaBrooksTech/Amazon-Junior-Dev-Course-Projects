# 📷 Camera Overloading Project

This Java project demonstrates **method overloading** through a simple `Camera` class with multiple `takePicture` methods. It showcases how Java can handle multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types and counts.

---

## 🧾 Project Description

The project consists of two classes:

### 🔸 `Main.java`
- The main entry point of the program.
- Creates an instance of the `Camera` class.
- Calls the overloaded `takePicture` methods using different parameters.

### 🔸 `Camera.java`
- Contains **three overloaded methods** named `takePicture`.
- Each method takes different types of arguments:
    - A `String` (e.g., `"portrait"`)
    - An `int` (e.g., `12`)
    - A combination of both `String` and `int`

## 💡 Concepts Practiced

- **Method Overloading** in Java
- Basic object-oriented programming
- Parameter handling in class methods
- `System.out.println` for console output

---

## 🧪 Example Output

When you run `Main.java`, the console will display:

Taking picture in portrait mode.
Taking picture in 12 megapixels.
Taking picture in 24 megapixels picture in landscape mode.


---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 24).
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or another Java IDE.
3. Ensure both `Main.java` and `Camera.java` are in the same package or directory.
4. Run `Main.java`.
